# Car Rental

This is a car rental project created by me with the intention of test my abilities in both frontend and backend. It working by simple choosing a date for pick the car and a date for return it, choose a car from your preference and make a rent! You can also see all the rents that you make.

ReactJS - Frontend
Fastify - Backend

You can just clone both projects (Car-Rental-Frontend and Car-Rental-Backend), and after that execute this two commands:

```
npm i

```

And there you have it!
